# Voice Assistant (Python)
__This script was built for personal demands, it helps me to work/have fun, do some multitasking, and do remote control of my pc when I'm doing something that keeps me out of the keyboard. It also helps me to showcase my skills with: Python/Scrapy/Pandas/Numpy/SQL/Pytorch/Windows/PowerBi__

The biggest advantage of having James is the possibility to do personalize it, which can make it more useful than the normal assistants are.

When running, the assistant will keep itself running fast cycles of 2 seconds hearing for the wake-up word. "Hey, James", "James" or just "Hey" can be used to call him. He will respond "I'm listening, sir" and then wait for the command for 8 seconds (this limitation was created because it kept itself lost hearing louder noises).
